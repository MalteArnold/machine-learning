This code performs classification on the Spambase dataset using three different Naive Bayes models (BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, GaussianNB) and evaluates their accuracy. It also includes additional diagnostic measures such as the confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and AUC for the BernoulliNB model with different binarization values. The dataset is loaded, prepared, split into training and test sets, and then each model is created, fitted, and evaluated for accuracy. The ROC curve and AUC are plotted for the BernoulliNB model with different binarization values.
