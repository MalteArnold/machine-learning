This Python code analyzes cars data using logistic regression. It loads and prepares the data, visualizes relationships between predictors, checks for missing values, examines the nature of the target variable, and ensures the dataset size is sufficient. The logistic regression is performed on selected predictors, and the model's accuracy is evaluated, including a detailed classification report.
