This code performs K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset and visualizes the ground truth and K-Means cluster assignments. It uses the petal length and width features for visualization. The clusters are visualized in a side-by-side comparison, and additional metrics such as the classification report, confusion matrix, and silhouette score are printed for evaluation. The `visualize_clusters` function takes care of creating the visualizations, and the main part of the code initializes and fits the KMeans model, performs visualization, and prints evaluation metrics.
