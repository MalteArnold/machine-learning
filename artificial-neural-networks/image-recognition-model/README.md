This code defines a simple neural network class using the sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm on a given dataset (MNIST) with specified parameters. After training, it evaluates the model on both the training and testing sets, printing a confusion matrix and common neural network measures (accuracy, recall, precision). The main function loads MNIST data, transforms labels, and executes the training and evaluation processes for a specified number of epochs.
