This code implements a simple neural network using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend. The network has one hidden layer with three neurons and an output layer with one neuron. The activation functions used are hyperbolic tangent (tanh) for the hidden layer and sigmoid for the output layer. Binary cross-entropy is used as the loss function, and Adam optimizer is employed for training.
